abstract = {Water flow in unsaturated soils that is induced by infiltration and root-water uptake processes is governed by Richard's equation. To study the governing equation more conveniently, it is transformed into a modified Helmholtz equation using the Kirchhoff transformation with dimensionless variables. In this study, we employ a dual reciprocity boundary element method (DRBEM) and the predictor–corrector method to numerically solve problems governed by the equation. The proposed method is tested on problems involving infiltration from periodic channels with root water uptake.}
